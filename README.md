Data Preparation

Given the enormity and messiness of raw data involved in data collection from
sensors and databases, we must fix them before feeding it to our machine
learning algorithms. This is our task before we do any analysis of any sort.

Raw data must be corrected and properly formatted. Consistent with this goal,
we define our dataset acceptable for analysis as:

  - Observations are in rows 
  
  - Variables are in columns 
  
  - Data is contained in a single dataset

We perform data preparation by checking variables, datatypes, missing values,
finding outliers in data, changing datatypes, replacing missing values, 
removing missing values, checking for duplicates, organizing multiple sources
of data into one, and so forth.

We first start by distinguishing two types of variables, quantitative and 
qualitative. Qualitative variables, also called categorical variables, are
variables that are not numerical.
